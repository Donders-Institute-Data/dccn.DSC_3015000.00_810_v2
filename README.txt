# Abstract

The auditory steady state evoked response (ASSR) is a robust and frequently utilized phenomenon in psychophysiological research. It reflects the auditory cortex excitability as a response of a frequency modulated auditory stimulus. The present report aims to provide an example of a group analysis in 29 healthy human participants in the context of an ASSR paradigm. First, analysis in the time domain will demonstrate descriptive evaluation and statistical control of auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). Second, frequency analysis is applied to describe the spectral characteristics of these ERPs followed by group level statistics in the frequency domain. Third, time and frequency domain data approaches are combined in order to describe the temporal and spectral development of the ASSR. Finally, an example of analysis in source space is applied in order to characterize the primary neural generators of the ASSR response.
